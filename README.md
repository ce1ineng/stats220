# STATS 220
Hello 👋 my name is Celine and I'm currently a 2nd year student studying at the University of Auckland. I'm studying both **Computer Science** and **Statistics** and am hoping to have a career in data science in the future!


### Some things I've been enjoying recently
* Food Wars anime 🍜
* Cats&Soup 🐱
* Badminton 🏸

### My favourite spots around the uni campus 
Finding a spot to studying while waiting in between classes is always such a struggle but if you walk around long enough you're sure to find some place to sit 😉
1. Law libray
2. Kate Edger Commons
3. OGGB
